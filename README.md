# Lesson Plan

## Day 1

1. [ ] Setup environment
2. [ ] Python 2 vs Python 3
3. [ ] Program on command line - Hello World
4. [ ] IDE
5. [ ] Basics - Interpreter etc.
6. [ ] Setup Git
7. [ ] Print Hello World and run file
8. [ ] Variable Basics
9. [ ] Comments
10. [ ] Debug

TODO

1. [ ] print without newlines.
2. [ ] print multiple variables in the same statement
3. [ ] Print multiple variables in the same statement separated by a "-"

## Day 2

1. [ ] Go over TODOs
2. [ ] input()
3. [ ] variable types
4. [ ] input typecasting
5. [ ] Play around with string (collection of char), int, bool and float - basics
6. [ ] Introduce operators (+-* ><= andOrNot) - Focus on ==, division (// for int vs / for float)

TODO

1. [ ] Multiple inputs from the same line
2. [ ] Write XOR using only AND and OR (pretty useless for learning the language. Just want to see if you can.)
3. [ ] Difficult - Convert an integer to binary. (or base anything really)
4. [ ] Easy - Say I have 4 variables each with a single digit number a=1 b=2 c=3 d=4, I want to get an answer to 12*34.
5. [ ] Try to implement 4 as a log division solution

## Day 3

1. Complicated operators - += -= %
2. String and int add and parsing
3. Complicating string - \n, escaping quotes, format (from string import Template, do not use),
4. Split a string,
5. == vs is (concept of pointers)
6. type() function

String as an array Find, Replace, Reverse a string, check palindrome

List - Any, All operators import math or import operator

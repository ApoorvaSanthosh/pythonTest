string1 = "To forget the dead"
string2 = "would be akin to killing them"
string3 = "a second time"

# Problem 1
# Multiple print statements, that prints these strings in the same line.
# Output expected - To forget the dead would be akin to killing them a second time
print(string1)
print(string2)
print(string3)

# Problem 2
# A single print statement that prints all these three strings seperated by a space
# Output expected - To forget the dead would be akin to killing them a second time
# There are 2 ways to do this
print()

# Problem 3
# A single print statement that prints all these three strings seperated by a dash
# Output expected - To forget the dead-would be akin to killing them-a second time
print()

# Problem 4
# Swap variables string1 and string2
# There are two ways to do this





print(string1)      # should read - would be akin to killing them
print(string2)      # should read - To forget the dead
